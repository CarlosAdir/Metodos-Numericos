# Numerical Integration

## Introduction

For the introduction, you can see the [documentation](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4.html) that explains very well the methods of numerical integration.

## Files

All the methods to integrate a function are implemented in the file ```methods.py```, and the following files shows how to use each method, with some examples of functions and intervals inside each file.

* [Retangular](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4_1.html): ```1_retangular.py```
* [Trapezoidal](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4_2.html): ```2_trapezoidal.py```
* [Simpson](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4_3.html): ```3_simpson.py```
* [Simpson 3/8](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4_4.html): ```4_simpson38.py```
