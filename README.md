## Objective

This repository is to storage and show some resolutions' exemples using computational algorithms in python. The problems are in the field:

1. Find root of one variable function
2. Interpolate points
3. Numerical integration
4. Solving Ordinary differential equation
5. Solve solution of linear systems


These algorithms are not optimased, since the objective is for educational purposes. Some of these algoritms are found in well documented and devoloped library, for exemple, the function ```solve``` in the ```numpy.linalg``` module that solves linear system.

## Documentation

To access our documentation and understand about the methods, [Read The Docs](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/).


## How to use

To use the code, you have to install these three libraries:

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

The easiest way to have these libraries is install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which install almost everything you need.
Another way, is install the [Python](https://www.python.org/) and after that install each package/library using the command ```pip install wanttedpackage```

## Bibliography

There are many books that shows us the algorithms, but the guide book is the **Richard L. Burden**'s book: **Numerical Analysis**.

## Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to our project:

* Become a colaborator
* Give ideas of the algorithms
* Show problems using the [Issues](https://github.com/carlos-adir/NumericalMethods/issues)
* Give implemented code using [Pull Requests](https://github.com/carlos-adir/NumericalMethods/pulls)
