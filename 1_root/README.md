# Solutions of equations of one variable

## Introduction

For the introduction, you can see the [documentation](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/1.html) that explains very well the methods to find the roots of a function.

## Files

All the methods to find roots are implemented in the file ```methods.py```, and the following shows how to use each method, with some examples inside each file.

* [Bisection](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/1_1.html): ```1_bissection.py```
* [Fixed Point](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/1_2.html): ```2_bissection.py```
* [Newton](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/1_3.html): ```3_newton.py```
* [Secant](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/1_4.html): ```4_secant.py```
* False Position: ```5_falseposition.py```
