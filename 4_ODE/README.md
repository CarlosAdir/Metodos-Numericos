# Ordinary Differential Equations

## Introduction

There are many algorithms that can solve numerically an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation).
The [documentation](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/4.html) explain the methods and it's recomended to see it if you want understand about the methods.


## Files

All the methods to solve the ODEs are implemented in the file ```methods.py```, the file ```input.py``` has examples of some ODEs that can be solved, and the ```interpolation.py``` file uses the interpolation implementation in the section [Interpolation](https://github.com/carlos-adir/NumericalMethods/tree/master/2_interpolation).
The following files are the examples showing how to use each of them

* Euler's Method: ```1_euler.py```
* Taylor order 2: ```2_taylor2.py```
* Taylor order 3: ```3_taylor3.py```
* Modified Euler's: ```4_modifiedeuler.py```
* Midpoint: ```5_midpoint.py```
* Heun's Method: ```6_heun.py```
* Runge Kutta(order 4): ```7_rungekutta.py```
