# Interpolation

## Introduction

For the introduction, you can see the [documentation](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/2.html) that explains very well how to find the interpolation functions.

## Files

All the methods for find the interpolation are in the file ```methods.py``` while the following files are examples showing how to use them. The links are the documentation for each method.

* [Lagrange](https://carlos-adir.github.io/NumericalMethods/2_1.html): ```1_lagrange.py```
